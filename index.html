<!-- NOTE: I realize my style.css sheet is all over the board. I had major trouble getting css to do what I wanted. I would LOVE to see a "solved" portion of this homework to see exactly where I went wrong so I could attempt to do this exercise again.  -->

				<p>
					I am a transplant to the Bay Area, having moved here from the Midewest in mid-2017 for my wife's work. For the past 10 years I have been a top performing REATLOR in Cincinnati. Prior to real estate I was successful in helping two companies - in the bank servicing and civil infrastructure industries, respectively - grow from small, local businesses into regional and national market leaders. 
				</p>
				<p>
					My wife and I are proud, adoptive parents in a transracial family. I value spending time with family and friends, travel, the outdoors, and doing charity work. I decided to make the career transition into web development and coding to broaden my skillsets and create new business opportunities.
